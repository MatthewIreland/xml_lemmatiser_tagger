.SH NAME
uni2beta \- Convert a polytonic Greek document from UTF-8 Unicode to Beta Code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B uni2beta
[{\-l|\-u}] [\-i \fIinput_file.beta\fP] [\-o \fIoutput_file.utf8\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBuni2beta\fP(1)
reads a document encoded using Unicode and converts it to
Beta Code.  Beta Code is an ASCII-only encoding scheme most
commonly used for digital representation of polytonic Greek.
.PP
Beta Code has become a widely-adopted standard for encoding
classical Greek.  It was developed by David Packard in the 1970s
and adopted by the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) Project at
the University of California, Irvine shortly thereafter.
This encoding was later adopted by the Perseus Project in the
1980s (originally at Harvard University, now at Tufts University)
and by many other collections of classical and Koine Greek.
Today, the TLG corpus alone contains over 100 million words
from classical to Byzantine Greek.
.PP
The TLG uses uppercase Latin letters for encoding;
the Perseus Project uses lowercase.
\fBuni2beta\fP(1)
defaults to lowercase output.  This can be overridden with
the `-u' (generate uppercase) option.
.PP
Many classicists who use Beta Code have been actively involved
in The Unicode Standard, with evolving recommendations for mapping
between Beta Code and Unicode.
\fBuni2beta\fP(1)
provides a capability for GNU/Linux users who wish to convert
Unicode texts to Beta Code.
.PP
Any encountered UTF-8 Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM), U+FFFE,
is ignored.
