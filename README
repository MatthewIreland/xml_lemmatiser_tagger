The applications may need to be rebuilt for your system,
look at applications/instructions for tips

Change to the 'run' directory and add source files
in the perseus format to the in folder

Then call loadApps to update the path
then ./allrunPar.sh -n nThreads(default 8) nameString(default "*.xml")
This will process all files in in/ which match "**/*.xml" in parallel with 8 threads
